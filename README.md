# NNStreamer Examples

This repository shows developers how to create applications using nnstreamer/gstreamer.
In order to show how to develop nnstreamer applications without building nnstreamer, but by simply installing nnstreamer packages, this repository is supposed to be built independently from nnstreamer.git.

We plan to provide the following example applications

- Linux native (Tizen/Ubuntu) nnstreamer applications
- gst-launch script applications
- Android GUI applications
- Tizen .NET (C#) applications
- Web applications (Tizen)
